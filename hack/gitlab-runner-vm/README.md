# GitLab Runner VM

Provisions GitLab Runner VMs on OpenShift Virtualization with a Podman custom
executor and OpenShell gateway for fullsend agent jobs.

> **Requires:** `oc`, `virtctl` (client >= 1.5 — ships with OpenShift Virtualization >= 4.19),
> `python3`, and a local `ssh` binary (virtctl wraps it via ProxyCommand).

## Architecture

Each runner VM runs:
- **gitlab-runner** (custom executor) — receives CI jobs from GitLab
- **Podman** (rootless) — creates per-job containers
- **OpenShell gateway** — provides sandbox compute for fullsend agents

Job containers use `--network=host` to reach the gateway. An OCI
`createRuntime` hook injects the host CA trust bundle into every container
(Debian and RHEL-family layouts) so jobs can verify internal TLS endpoints.
Gateway mTLS credentials are mounted read-only from the runner user's
OpenShell config.

This is a deployment variant of the container isolation model described in
ADR-0036. It uses a Podman custom executor instead of Docker/Kubernetes
executors but maintains equivalent container-level isolation for agent jobs.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create and provision a VM (auto-numbers):
GL_TOKEN=glpat-xxx PROJECT_ID=12345 \
  GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com \
  NAMESPACE=my-namespace \
  RUNNER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/org/runner:v1.2.3 \
  ./create-vm.sh

# 2. Delete a VM:
GL_TOKEN=glpat-xxx \
  GITLAB_URL=https://gitlab.example.com \
  NAMESPACE=my-namespace \
  ./delete-vm.sh fullsend-gitlab-runner-01

# 3. List VMs:
NAMESPACE=my-namespace ./delete-vm.sh --list
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GL_TOKEN` | yes | — | GitLab PAT (Owner role, scopes: `create_runner` + `manage_runner` + `api`) |
| `PROJECT_ID` | yes (create) | — | GitLab project ID |
| `GITLAB_URL` | yes | — | GitLab instance URL |
| `NAMESPACE` | yes (create/delete) | — | OpenShift namespace |
| `RUNNER_IMAGE` | yes | — | Image pre-pulled as a warm cache; jobs must still set `image:` in `.gitlab-ci.yml` |
| `RUNNER_TAG` | no | `fullsend-gitlab-runner` | Runner tag for job matching |
| `VM_USER` | no | `fedora` | Cloud-image login user (`cloud-user` on RHEL/CentOS Stream images) |
| `RUNNER_ACCESS_LEVEL` | no | `not_protected` | `ref_protected` restricts the runner to protected branches and tags, so merge-request pipelines on unprotected source refs never match and sit `pending`. Note the trade-off: with `not_protected`, any job on any branch of the project runs on this VM and can read the mounted gateway credentials (see Security below) — set `ref_protected` if the runner only needs to serve protected refs |
| `OPENSHELL_VERSION` | no | from `.github/scripts/openshell-version.sh` | OpenShell version (Renovate-tracked) |
| `GITLAB_RUNNER_VERSION` | no | `19.2.1` | gitlab-runner version |
| `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY` | no | contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `id_ed25519.pub` | SSH public key contents (not a path) |
| `REGISTRATION_TOKEN` | setup only | — | GitLab runner registration token |

## Files

- `create-vm.sh` — end-to-end VM creation + runner registration + setup
- `delete-vm.sh` — VM teardown + runner deregistration
- `setup.sh` — standalone VM configuration (called by create-vm.sh)
- `gitlab-runner-version.sh` — central pin for the gitlab-runner version
- `vm.yaml` — KubeVirt VirtualMachine template
- `executor/prepare.sh` — custom executor prepare stage
- `executor/run.sh` — custom executor run stage
- `executor/cleanup.sh` — custom executor cleanup stage

## Security notes

- The CA trust bootstrap uses trust-on-first-use (TOFU). For higher assurance,
  provide the CA bundle out-of-band before running setup.sh.
- The OCI CA-injection hook fires for all containers on the host. It only
  copies a CA bundle file and is scoped to the `createRuntime` stage.
- Job containers share the host network namespace (`--network=host`) to reach
  the OpenShell gateway. The gateway binds to `0.0.0.0` (required for the
  Podman compute driver — sandbox containers register via
  `host.containers.internal`). mTLS protects the endpoint.
- Job containers receive read-only access to the runner's gateway mTLS
  credentials (`~/.config/openshell`). This is required for the fullsend
  agent inside job containers to authenticate to the gateway. The runner is
  scoped to one project by `runner_type=project_type` and `locked=true`, so
  only jobs from that project can access these credentials; `run_untagged=false`
  narrows this further to tag-matched jobs. If job-scoped credential minting
  is added to the gateway, this mount should be replaced with short-lived
  per-job tokens.
