# Forward CI environment variables into the container.
# GitLab Runner exposes job variables as CUSTOM_ENV_* — strip the prefix and
# forward each one with `--env NAME` (no value). Podman then copies the value
# from its own environment, so secrets never appear in argv or on disk. A
# line-delimited --env-file cannot carry these safely: file-type CI/CD
# variables (PEM material, keys) contain newlines, which an `env`-parsing loop
# truncates to the first line, and a continuation line beginning with
# CUSTOM_ENV_ would be re-parsed as an attacker-chosen assignment.
# The exports happen in a subshell that execs podman, so a job variable
# named PATH or HOME cannot alter this script's own environment. Names that
# would change how the podman *process itself* behaves (locating conmon and
# the OCI runtime, its storage/config, its home) are never secrets, so those
# few are passed inline as NAME=VALUE instead of through podman's environ.
